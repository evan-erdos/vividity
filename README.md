A Work of Interactive Fiction / A Study in Adventure Puzzles and Overwriting

---
This repository holds my first foray into writing Interactive Fiction, and also my first attempt at writing fiction. I ported the initial work I did in Inform 7 to TADS3, but in the backup directory, the project files specific to Inform 7, still exist. Before, the format was *.z8, which is z-machine code, readable by a z-machine interpreter, examples being the web-based [Parchment](https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment/tree/inform7/ “Parchment”) [Interpreter](http://iplayif.com/ "Interpreter"), or the [jzip](http://jzip.sourceforge.net/ "jzip") interpreter, for the command line. TADS3 compiles to a *.t3 format, readable by it's own interpreter, [frob](https://github.com/realnc/frobtads "FrobTADS").

This is a rather severe departure from my other _excessively_-multimedia-based projects which use sound and graphics along with writing to create an experience, evoke emotions, tell a story, et cetera. A text adventure can _only_ rely on text. While I would otherwise have flashy 3D graphics and sounds to employ, in this medium I can only rely on my writing impetus to move the reader. It is quite a bit more difficult to bring users to tears with only writing, but hopefully the process itself will bring me closer to that goal, which is, as it was explained to me, how to get rich and famous. With the intentions of strengthening my writing by being totally reliant upon it to express ideas, and getting rich and famous, I undertake this endeavor in earnest.

Todo:
- formalize the class / kind definitions, update verbiage and usage
- establishing some kind of plot might be good
- consolidate player attributes, encapsulate attributes of other NPCs
- change the behaviour of look and examine to give a verbose description
- get statusbar / new block to display current room description
- implement inventory / dealing with multiple objects
- use a git add submodule to link the compiler's source
