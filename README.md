A Work of Interactive Fiction / A Study in Adventure Puzzles and Overwriting

This repository is my foray into Inform 7 "programming" and creative writing in the second person / writing for the format of a Text Adventure. The format is *.z8, z-machine code readable by a z-machine interpreter like the web-based Parchment interpreter or the command-line jzip interpreter. This is a serious departure from my other extremely-multimedia-based projects which use sound and graphics along with writing to create an experience, evoke emotions, tell a story, et cetera. Interactive Fiction has to accomplish the same with ONLY text, which should lead to more powerful / expressive writing.
